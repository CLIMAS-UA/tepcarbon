# TEP Carbon Goals

This repository contains the data and analysis University of Arizona
researchers used to guide Tucson Electric Power's carbon goals as part
of their 2020 IRP process.

The jupyter notebook [tep_carbon.ipynb](tep_carbon.ipynb) contains the
analysis. The input data lives in the [data](data) directory and the output
``png`` and ``csv`` files live in the [output](output) directory. The plot
below shows an example.
